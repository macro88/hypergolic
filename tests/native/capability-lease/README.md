# Native capability lease proofs

These standalone, host-executed programs exercise the production Java and Swift
registry implementations, with an injected monotonic clock. Each reports 100
assertions: exact expiry, admission limits, sequence consumption/replay/gaps,
UTF-8 bounds, one-use claim, generation revocation and concurrent claim ownership.
They do not instantiate a WebView or exercise Expo modules.

On macOS with the configured JDK and Xcode toolchains, from the repository root:

```sh
proof_directory=$(mktemp -d)
javac -d "$proof_directory" modules/napplet-host/android/src/main/java/org/nostrocket/hypergolic/host/CapabilityLeaseRegistry.java tests/native/capability-lease/CapabilityLeaseProof.java
java -cp "$proof_directory" CapabilityLeaseProof
xcrun swiftc -swift-version 6 -warnings-as-errors -parse-as-library modules/napplet-host/ios/CapabilityLeaseRegistry.swift tests/native/capability-lease/CapabilityLeaseProof.swift -o "$proof_directory/swift-proof"
"$proof_directory/swift-proof"
```

See [native admission evidence](../../../docs/native-capabilities.md) for the real
SQLite broker tests and separately executed WKWebView checks.
