# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-14)

**Core value:** Shell control of identity and privileged operations.
**Current focus:** Native napplet storage admission and State Lab after protected entry, workspace persistence and confirmed identity switching.

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 3 (Independent Android and iOS proof / seed phase 1)
Plan: 02-03 secure identities and saved state; remaining 02-07 device acceptance
Status: Identity entry, workspace persistence and import/switch UI integrated; isolated native journeys pass on both platforms; privileged napplet capabilities and physical security remain open
Last activity: 2026-09-15 — Confirmed import and whole-shell switching now preserve cancelled live sessions and restart all loaded napplets under the selected identity. Android's isolated standalone Release app passed import/selector/restart using the production vault. The separate iOS public-key-only fixture passed the shared UI journey after fixing modal safe areas. Neither substitutes for physical-iPhone protected storage. There are 71 storage/transition tests, 278 security tests, 13 bootstrap tests and 25 shell tests; full aislop is 100/100 and React Doctor has zero findings, with external numeric scoring still pending. Weekly usage last checked at 11%; stop at 45%. Progress metadata counts plans, not product completion.

Previous environment checkpoint: 2026-09-12 — local iOS development setup completed: native Simulator Debug build, input/navigation, Hermes/logging, reload, Fast Refresh and cold launch verified. Original scaffold and Android artifacts preserved. This environment checkpoint does not advance the product/security phase; see docs/development.md.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See `docs/architecture.md` for confirmed requirements and unresolved policy.

### Blockers/Concerns

First theme-only native contract is selected. Validate privileged adapters and delivery contracts before their dependent work. Preserve Expo 57.0.20 despite the existing Doctor patch-version mismatch. Source remote/push remains owner-only.
Resume budget: check the account usage counter after each small batch and stop at 45% weekly usage, saving a checkpoint before stopping.
Android emulator and iPhone Simulator scaffold checks are verified. Physical-iPhone signing and execution remain untested; native security acceptance is still open.
See `docs/phase-zero.md` for actual checks and artifacts.
